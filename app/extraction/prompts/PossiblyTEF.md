Context: TEF-related links to initiatives (if present) in Climate City Contract documents.

- Only create an entry when a TEF identifier is explicitly tied to an initiative; otherwise skip vague mentions. If the TEF ID is missing but the linkage is clear, leave the ID blank (a placeholder will be assigned). Do not fabricate TEF IDs.
- Capture any additional useful information not covered by other fields in the `misc` field as a JSON object.
