Context: Climate City Contract (CCC) documents describing city-level climate action plans and their contractual metadata.

- Look for contract-level facts such as contract date, document title, version, language, and any official document URL.
- Use the city name exactly as written (e.g., "City of Dresden") when pairing to city_id if present; do not invent IDs.
- If the contract ID, dates, or URLs are not explicit, leave them blank; placeholders will be assigned as needed.
- Capture any additional useful information not covered by other fields in the `misc` field as a JSON object.
