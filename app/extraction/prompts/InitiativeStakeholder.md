Context: Relationships between initiatives and stakeholders within the Climate City Contract.

- Capture rows that pair a stakeholder to an initiative with a stated role (e.g., lead, partner, funder); include notes if present.
- If IDs are missing, leave them blank (placeholders will be assigned). Skip only when neither initiative nor stakeholder can be identified.
- Capture any additional useful information not covered by other fields in the `misc` field as a JSON object.
