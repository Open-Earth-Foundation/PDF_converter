Context: Extract budget funding sources and financed amounts (focus on capturing data now; linking can be resolved later).

- Capture the funding source name, any type/description provided, the financed amount, and currency exactly as written.
- Leave missing IDs blank (placeholders are assigned automatically). Do not skip rows just because IDs are absent.
- Capture any additional useful information not covered by other fields in the `misc` field as a JSON object.
