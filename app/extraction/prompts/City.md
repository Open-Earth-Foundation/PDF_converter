Context: City-level metadata referenced in Climate City Contract documents.

- Capture the exact city name and country as written in the action plan (e.g., Dresden, Germany).
- If locode or area are explicitly stated, include them; otherwise leave them out rather than guessing.
- Do not fabricate UUIDs or numerical values; only record cities when key facts are present.
- Capture any additional useful information not covered by other fields in the `misc` field as a JSON object.
