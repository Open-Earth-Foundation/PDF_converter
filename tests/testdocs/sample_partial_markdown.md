Climate Neutrality Action Plan

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

With its climate protection concept adopted in 1992, the city of Heidelberg was one of the first cities in Germany to have a systematic plan for climate protection at the local level, backed up by measures. Under the motto "think globally - act locally," decisive steps were taken in the 1990s to set the course for municipal climate protection. In 1997, this also included the establishment of a local energy consulting service, which today has expanded its sphere of activity as the Heidelberg and Rhine-Neckar District Climate Protection Agency and supports municipalities and the citizens of the entire region in their climate protection efforts.

Influenced by the international sustainability debate, the Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag, and the conferences in Aalborg and Rio, the goals of Heidelberg's climate protection and CO2 reduction were also incorporated into the city's sustainability strategy, the Urban Development Plan, in 1997.

Supplemented by the energy concept and the transport development plan, as well as numerous updates, Heidelberg has succeeded in anchoring climate protection programmatically and financially in many of the city's departments, as well as motivating external actors to actively protect the climate. Most recently, the establishment of a separate department for climate protection, the environment and mobility in 2020 strengthened the organizational anchoring of climate protection in the administration.

An important milestone in Heidelberg's climate protection process is the "100 % Climate Protection Master Plan" adopted by the municipal council in 2014 and updated in 2019. In this approach to climate neutrality 2050, which was funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment and developed in exchange with 40 municipalities, Heidelberg was able to adopt climate protection strategies as a model municipality, which had previously been developed in a comprehensive participation process.

Other innovative approaches and bundles of measures complement Heidelberg's efforts towards climate protection and sustainability. These include, for example, the Sustainable Business Network with its focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, the city administration's energy concept for its own properties, the heat transformation path, and green district heating.

In 2019, the climate emergency was declared and the Climate Action Plan 2020 was adopted. This accelerated the implementation of measures and politicians set the financial course for consistent climate protection.

Heidelberg started the process of "Green recovery" as part of the C40 network 2020.

Heidelberg's brought-forward climate neutrality target arose from the target debate surrounding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 and the updated neutrality targets of the German federal government and the state of Baden-Württemberg. The climate protection law of the Federal Republic of Germany was brought forward to the year 2045 with the decision in June 2021. The climate protection law in Baden-Württemberg aims to achieve net greenhouse gas neutrality gradually by 2040.

In July 2022, the Heidelberg City Council passed the following resolution: The City of Heidelberg undertakes to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection in line with its participation in the EU mission "climate-neutral and smart cities". Complete climate neutrality according to the municipal BISKO accounting is to be achieved by 2040 at the latest. For the city administration, in particular the municipal properties, the aim is to achieve the greatest possible climate neutrality by 2030.

Heidelberg's climate neutrality policy is embedded in the historical and environmental policy context described here, on which the membership and activities in the EU mission project "100 climate-neutral and smart cities" are based.

The decision of the municipal council to participate in the EU-Mission project leads to an acceleration of the implementation of measures in the municipality, the closing of ranks of local actors, the linking of fields of action and thus a restructured and systematic approach to the transformation of society combined with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

## Build a strong mandate

The City of Heidelberg has a long history of climate action since its first climate protection concept in 1992. However, being part of the EU Mission “100 climate neutral and intelligent cities” is of great importance for the City to accelerate climate action. The first step was the council’s decision in June 2022 to work consistently towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030 in all fields of action and to give priority to climate protection. After that, the municipality was in a position to start. The first step was to set up a steering committee within the city administration to ensure that climate protection is mainstreamed across key departments. The steering committee now meets on a regular basis. Secondly, the already existing Mayor’s Climate Action Group, which includes some of Heidelberg’s key stakeholders, was informed and involved in the mission’s process. In addition, a broader range of companies and organisations are planned to be involved in the mission’s process. Therefore, the city offered the opportunity to sign a cooperation agreement to be part of the mission and to signal the will to pull together.

The City of Heidelberg is active in many networks on regional, national and international levels, such as for example Städtetag Baden-Württemberg, deutscher Städtetag, Klimabündnis, C40, GCM or Energy Cities (https://www.heidelberg.de/hd/HD/Leben/Netzwerke.html). The exchange between these cities is important to learn from each other and to have a political representation at different levels of government. The EU Mission is another essential network that allows Heidelberg to build strong relations with other European and German lead cities, especially on the Mission Platform and at personal meetings. The nine German cities have set up a bi-weekly call in order to share their experiences and progresses in the mission. Moreover, there is an exchange between the German mission cities and the German Government.

## Understand the system

The City of Heidelberg monitors its GHG emissions on a regular basis by a BISKO CO2-balance. For the Climate City Contract, Heidelberg uses the data from 2019 to not take advantage of the outlier Corona-years. The CO2-balance shows the gap of the different sectors to reach climate neutrality.

As climate protection had been a major topic in Heidelberg since the 1990s many connections and relationships have been made across administration departments and other stakeholders. However, there still exist some systemic barriers that need to be unveiled. This is what the climate city contract is helpful for. Furthermore, Heidelberg will identify within the contract the most important levers of change to reach climate neutrality by 2030. The contract also unpacks the strategy for financing the actions needed.

## Co-design a portfolio

Cities and municipalities play an important role in the development and implementation of climate protection measures. This applies to their own administrative organisation, but also to other areas within their own sphere of influence.

There are many fields of action that municipalities can influence directly and indirectly, for example in the area of municipal infrastructure or municipal enterprises. Furthermore, municipalities are the interface to citizens, the local economy or social and cultural institutions. In addition to their own climate neutrality, the provision of climate-friendly supply and transport infrastructures, urban development, refurbishments or information and funding offers are possible levers. Overall, municipalities have a great influence on greenhouse gas emissions. They occupy a key position in climate protection.

Within the fields of action in climate protection, a municipality can take on various roles. They can be active as consumers and role models, suppliers and providers, planners and regulators, as well as advisors and promoters. Depending on the role of the municipality, its influence on greenhouse gas reduction potentials differs: as a consumer, for example, it is the cause of greenhouse gas emissions and can exert direct influence on the future consumption of its own properties, while in other areas it can exert influence more through regulation and consultation.

In July 2022, the municipal council passed a resolution for a climate-neutral administration for Heidelberg in 2030.

In the case of city properties such as schools, administrative buildings, day-care centres and other operational facilities such as the professional fire brigade, the positive effects of Heidelberg's climate protection over many years are becoming apparent. Final energy consumption has already been reduced by 65 percent.

The EU Mission is thus not a task only for the municipality but also for all civil stakeholders, organisations and companies in Heidelberg. Therefore, there will be an accompanying transition group with all these stakeholders to start and implement climate protection measures and interventions. The contract shows financing options and allows to estimate co-benefits and impacts. To ensure long-term implementation it is important that Heidelberg simultaneously adapts policies and regulations.

The Climate City Contract is regularly updated so that an iteration process takes place every two years. By regularly renewing the Climate City Contract, new findings, adapted framework conditions and regulations as well as technological developments can be taken into account. In particular, measures from other planning processes, such as the Climate Mobility Plan, are incorporated. In this way, a dynamic plan is created that can be developed together with existing and new actors and citizen participation.

The map below shows Heidelberg's city boundaries, covering around 109 km². This area is addressed by the action plan. Moreover the land use is pictured.

For the year 2030 0.270 t CO2 equivalent per MWh final energy is assumed (https://www.kea-bw.de/waermewende/wissensportal/technikkatalog). Based on historical data and forecasts, assumptions are made about how the energy mix for electricity generation will evolve by 2030. This includes expectations for increased use of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro) and reduced use of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas). Nevertheless, this is accompanied by risks in case the assumption is not being met. If the emission factor remains higher than expected Heidelberg's climate neutrality goals might not be met. Therefore it might become indispensable to reevaluate the city's emission reduction strategies to still meet the goal. Moreover, if the city relies on country-wide renewable energy sources, a failure to achieve the emissions factor target may require a reassessment of the feasibility of local sufficiency concepts. Consequently, Heidelberg has to reassess its renewable energy potential and consider expanding renewable energy capacity to compensate for higher emissions from grid electricity.

| Strategy | local | Modell Räumliche Ordnung 2035+ model of spatial order (MRO) | The MRO is the spatial strategy for Heidelberg and aims to develop a model for urban development that coordinates the various usage requirements in the city. The MRO is intended to qualify the preparatory land use plan. | The MRO is being developed by the City Planning Office with the support of planners from landscape architecture and urban planning as well as other specialized offices of the City of Heidelberg. The interdependencies are shown, which are of importance for spatial development due to population growth, new mobility needs and climate change, among others. | In particular, the chapters on climate and mobility are relevant for EU mission. The previous concept from 1999 is currently being updated with the participation of the citizens, among other things because of the population development. The aspects and goals of climate neutrality will be included in the update. |

| Strategy | Local | Biodiversity strategy | The strategy was developed in close cooperation between the city administration, nature conservation associations and other institutions. The Heidelberg City Council unanimously adopted the goals and measures of the Heidelberg Biodiversity Strategy on Thursday, March 18, 2021. Financing for the individual building blocks is to be generated primarily through funding from the state, the federal government and calls for tenders as part of nature conservation projects. In this way, the city joins many other municipalities in supporting the goals of the federal government's national biodiversity strategy and the nature conservation strategy of the state of Baden-Württemberg. The city's goal is to permanently preserve and promote species and habitats. | The crises in climate protection and biodiversity (also known as the twin crisis) are among the major challenges for preserving the Earth as a habitat. They must be thought of together. | Implementation of the biodiversity strategy measures. Likewise, the preservation of green belts and fresh air corridors as well as open spaces as climate change adaptation measures. |

## A-2.2: Description & assessment of policies

Federal and state regulations provide the framework for municipal action. Climate protection and climate adaptation must be given strong weight in all sectoral laws and planning directives, with clearly defined goals and instruments to support municipal efforts and enable legally secure implementation. An intensive dialogue between the federal, state and local governments on the legal framework and legal changes in sectoral laws and ordinances is necessary for the reduction of barriers and effective climate protection.

¹ Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
² Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU).

Emissions gaps will be addressed by Heidelberg by various strategies and actions to make sure 100% of the emissions are considered. These are listed in Part C of this document.

Several hundred enterprises are already part of the Network "Sustainable management in Small and Medium sized Enterprises". The aim of the network, which has been coordinated by the Office of Environmental Protection, Trade Supervision and Energy since 2001, is to support small and medium-sized enterprises with 5 to 250 employees in implementing an environmental management system. This includes the investigation of internal processes and optimization potentials, in particular with regard to resource consumption and disposal as well as occupational safety for the protection of employees and the environment. Questions of social sustainability, such as new forms of personnel management or corporate social responsibility are also adressed. With about 200 involved companies and around 10.000 employees this network is one of the largest sustainability networks of companies in Germany. | Business Industrials: Emissions reduction Energy Transport (Mobility) Waste Water        | ...

# A-3.2:

A significant increase in population is forecast for the city of Heidelberg. More than 25,000 additional citizens are expected by 2035.

The city of Heidelberg decided on the future development of housing construction with the Building Land Programme for Housing (2017). This programme sets a target of 800 flats per year. The areas actively controlled by the city include the former military properties as well as Bahnstadt. In total, more than 12,000 new flats are planned. This means that significant increases in residential space can be expected in the coming years compared to the years before.

One important reason why absolute CO2 emissions in Heidelberg are not falling more significantly is precisely this growth in population. It is obvious to analyse this by looking at the per capita emissions. In 1987, these were just under 9.8 tonnes per capita, in 2017 they were 6.8 tonnes per capita. This corresponds to a reduction of 30 %. A great success, but it must be taken into account that CO2 emissions do not increase or decrease linearly with the number of inhabitants. The number of public facilities, such as the size of the university, municipal buildings, such as the state buildings, or the number of commercial and industrial enterprises is also responsible for the level of CO2 emissions, and does not directly depend on the influx of new citizens. Furthermore, all sectors continue to be equipped with electrical consumers. Increasing air-conditioning of buildings and increasing digitalisation with decentralised IT equipment are still causing a slight increase in electricity consumption. Nevertheless, the high per capita reduction also shows the success of Heidelberg's climate protection policy to date.

An increase in the number of inhabitants from 2017 by a further 15,000 to 175,000 would, according to a simple calculation, cause an additional 100,000 tonnes of CO2. After differentiated consideration (taking into account efficient housing), there would still be approx. 38,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions if calculated on the basis of 2017. The additional emissions of new residents can only be drastically reduced through consistent Plus-Energy standards for new neighbourhoods and flats, reduction of living space and extensive use of environmental transport.

**Necessary framework conditions for successful climate protection in municipalities**

In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality, the creative power of municipalities is not sufficient. Additional support from outside is necessary, and framework conditions must be created by the EU level, the federal government and the federal states to support municipalities in effective climate protection. Targets for energy and environmental policy are set at the EU level. Clear, reliable regulations help national policy and thus also the municipalities. Beyond the targets, various directives also set the course for climate protection at the municipal level. At present, the EU's framework is still quite broad; significantly more ambitious targets for the EU member states would lend greater weight to climate protection.

The German government advocates a target triad of greenhouse gas reduction, expansion of renewable energies and energy efficiency. A climate policy should strengthen the municipalities in their role as central shapers of the energy transition. The federal and state governments should support municipal decision-makers in consolidating the success of municipal climate action. It needs political willingness and explicit support at all political levels - without bypassing the principle of subsidiarity. This manifests itself not only in long-term goals, but also in concrete measures that set the energy and climate policy framework.

Tax incentives for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies create suitable economic incentives in conjunction with a further design of the financial support programmes. This benefits energy efficiency in particular (e.g. building renovation), which has so far lagged significantly behind the targets. The promotion of renewable energies should be given a reliable long-term framework. At the municipal level, the simplification for owner-users of solar electricity is a driver for the further expansion of solar energy. There is still a lot of potential here. An amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act is needed that abolishes the burden on self-consumption of renewable electricity. A federal climate protection law is urgently needed that gives climate protection a clear legal position in all relevant fields of action and provides for interactions with existing laws in the building sector, urban development and spatial planning, the energy industry, mobility and agriculture.

The federal states can make specifications through state legislation that directly affect municipalities and cities. For example, they could declare climate protection as a goal for municipalities within the framework of municipal ordinances (or municipal constitutions) or within the framework of state climate protection concepts (NRW, Baden-Württemberg). It would be possible and sensible to stipulate climate protection as a mandatory task (at least for precisely defined areas) at the state level, but in the political discussion the danger is often pointed out that federal funding programmes (municipal guidelines) can then no longer be used, as mandatory tasks may not be funded. In the

case of wind power, on the one hand the obstacles in the approval procedures are too high, on the other hand the resistance from the citizens is a great challenge. Here, a simplified participation model for citizens' wind farms and guaranteed financial returns for site communities could ensure new acceptance.

Achieving the climate protection goals does not only depend on the municipality. An interplay of different levels (EU, federal government, state, municipality) is necessary to achieve climate neutrality in Heidelberg. As part of a research project commissioned by the Federal Environment Agency on the impact potential of municipal climate protection measures, ifeu investigated the possibilities for municipalities to influence CO2 reduction. The research project showed that the proportion of emissions that can be influenced depends strongly on the circumstances of the municipality, e.g. its size, existing actors (e.g. municipal utilities, housing associations) and the energy infrastructure. Within the framework of the project, four areas of influence were defined, each of which was graded by the strength of the possibility of influence.

However, it is essential for municipalities to better assess in the future which possibilities they have to reduce their own energy and CO2 balance.

_Figure: Spheres of influence of the municipality on greenhouse gas emissions in its territory (ifeu 2018)_

percent of the emissions are in area 4 (advising & motivating). The emissions in this sphere of influence can be addressed in particular through measures such as neighbourhood concepts, information campaigns and support programmes. Around 1/4 of the emissions are in area 2a (supply & offer). The implementation of heat planning is the central measure to reduce CO2 emissions in this area. Another 4% of the emissions are in areas 1 and 1a (consumption and example). The total emissions in these areas can be directly influenced by the energy refurbishment of the municipal properties and the residential buildings of the GGH.

## Successful participation in climate protection

To achieve sustained success, climate protection needs to be an integral aspect in all decisions on investment, purchase and management of companies, public organisations and private households. This needs knowledge and awareness about relevance and chances of individual action. Opportunities for climate protection include, in particular, cost savings, security of supply, improvements in the quality of life, employee motivation, public image and new market opportunities. Thus awareness raising and participation processes play a key role in the successful planning and implementation of municipal climate protection measures in Heidelberg. The main goals are motivating for climate protection, develop common strategies, identify best solutions and develop new business cases for sustainable products and services.

Further aims are to integrate the technical and economic know-how of selected social stakeholders in order to close knowledge gaps and improve the quality of concept and measure planning. On the other hand, the active involvement of the various stakeholders raises awareness of the municipality's climate protection goals and measures at an early stage, and their concerns and suggestions are incorporated into the design of the measures. In this way, the subsequent implementation of the measures is promoted. Acceptance or even identification with the climate protection goals and measures of the municipality are thus central goals of participation processes.

For the selection of the formats and the addressing of the actors it is also important, which motivation / which self-interest has the target group in the topic of climate protection? For example:

Cost savings through energy efficiency measures,
positive image in the public,
Increase of awareness,
improvement of their own quality of life

When addressing stakeholders, Heidelberg prioritises according to the following criteria.

![Stakeholder prioritization matrix](img-9.jpeg)
_Figure 10: Stakeholder prioritization matrix_

**High relevance / High interest:** These stakeholders are closely involved in the process, as described below. The cooperation in the different formats builds on close contacts and a trusting cooperation in which objections or wishes are taken seriously and discussed together.
**High relevance / Low interest:** As this group of actors is crucial for the success of the project, this group of actors is specifically addressed with topics through which they can gain access to climate protection. It is also important to develop an awareness of which of their interests are contrary to the municipality's climate protection efforts and why this is the case. One example is the Climate Action Group led by the Mayor. He is a door opener and motivator for participation, especially for this group of actors.
**Low relevance / High interest:** Stakeholders with high interest but low relevance are regularly informed by the City of Heidelberg about climate protection activities (e.g. climate protection newsletter) and have the opportunity for low-threshold participation in suitable circumstances. Examples here are events with participatory offers (e.g. quizzes). This ensures that they feel included and recognised as actors in the process. This in turn helps to prevent any resistance to planned measures.
**Low relevance / Low interest:** For these actors, we make a point of keeping them in mind and informing them about the process or project as soon as they show interest.

Depending on the competencies and responsibilities, stakeholders are involved in accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. This means:

Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in all buildings and facilities (so-called "stationary energy"). This includes residential, commercial and industrial buildings as well as municipal buildings, properties and

public lighting within the city limits; climate neutrality, as defined by ifeu, requires the complete replacement of all fossil fuels for heat supply, primarily through district heating and heat pumps.
Emissions from fossil fuel combustion for all vehicles and transport within the city limits; a focus must be on measures to reduce emissions from commuter traffic, especially a strong expansion of public transport in the region, incentives to switch to zero-emission drives and bicycles, but also city tolls or vehicle/parking space levies must be investigated.
Emissions from consumption of electricity and district heating/cooling within the city boundary, from power plants within or outside the city boundary;
Massive expansion of renewable energies for electricity and heat production.

In the following, priority is given to formats in which the actors are addressed as consumers and are to learn about and learn behavioral changes via the various methods. We also attach great importance to target-group-specific stakeholder participation. For this purpose, some formats are presented under A-3.1.
